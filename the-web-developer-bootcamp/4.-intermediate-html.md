# 4. Intermediate HTML

## HTML Table

* `<table>` tag
* `<tr>` represents a **table row**
* `<td>` represents an **element in the row**
* To have borders for the table, we could implement this by CSS. But in the old-fashioned HTML way, set the _**border**_ attribute of the table element to `"1"`.
  * Example: `<table border="1">`
* To make the **code** more viewable \(the appearance in the browser is exactly the same\), we could put the heading row in a `<thead>` element and put the content rows in a `<tbody>` element.
