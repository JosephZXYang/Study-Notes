# 16. Advanced DOM Manipulation

## Intro to Events

* `obj.addEventListener(some_event, some_action)`
  * Makes the element interactive
  * `some_event` should be a built-in event
  * `some_action` should be a defined function
  * When `some_event` happens, `some_action` is executed
* `change` event
  * When the input value has changed
* `mouseover` event
  * When the mouse is hovering on the element
* `mouseout` event
  * When the hovering ends
