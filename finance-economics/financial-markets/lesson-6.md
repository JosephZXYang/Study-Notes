# Lesson 6

## Forecasting

* **Efficient Markets Hypothesis**
  * It's **not** a random walk, but a **random walk with growth**

## Intuition of Efficiency

* Three forms for market efficiency \(Harry Roberts\)
  1. **Weak form: information in past prices cannot help to forecast**
  2. **Semi-strong form: all publicly information is already incorporated in the market prices**
  3. **Strong form: all information including inside information held by the companies is already incorporated in the stock prices**
* The efficient market hypothesis is half-truth
  * Sometimes, when the market becomes "really crazy", it is necessary that the central bank controls it a bit.

## Price as PDV

* The Gordon model
  * The price of a stock should be the present discounted value of expected dividends
  * $$P = \frac{D}{r-g}$$
  * $$P=$$the price of the stock
  * $$D=$$expectation of next year's dividend
  * $$r=$$the minimum expected return rate such that investors are willing to buy the stock
  * $$g=$$the growth rate of dividend
