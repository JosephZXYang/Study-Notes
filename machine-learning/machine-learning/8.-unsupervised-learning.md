# 8. Unsupervised Learning

## Clustering

* Group data points to different segments
* Data points do not have labels
* Unsupervised learning algorithm

## K-means Clustering

* Most widely used clustering algorithm
* **Steps**
  1. Randomize $$K$$ cluster centroids
  2. Go through all data points. Assign each point to its closest centroid. 
  3. Compute mean for each cluster. Move cluster centroids to their mean.
  4. Repeat step 2, 3 until convergence
* The loss function of K-means should be constantly decreasing w.r.t. more iterations. If the loss function is increasing, then the code must be buggy.
* Random initialization:
  * Randomly pick $$K$$ data points from all data points. Set the centroids to these points.
  * K-means could end up to different local optima due to different initialization
  * Solution: Run the algorithm with many different random initializations. Pick the one with lowest cost at the end.
* How to choose $$K$$
  * Elbow method
    * Plot the cost function against number of clusters
    * Find the turning point of rapid decrease and slow decrease
    * Not used very often
  * Based on a metric for future performance in actual usage
