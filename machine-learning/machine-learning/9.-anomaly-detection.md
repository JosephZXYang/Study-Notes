# 9. Anomaly Detection

## Example

* Given a dataset of **normal** data points
* Decide if a given new one is anomalous or not
* **Density estimation**
* **Fraud detection**
  * **Anomalous user**

## Gaussian Distribution

* **Normal distribution**
* Parameters
  * Mean $$\mu$$
  * Variance $$\sigma^2$$

## Algorithm

* An independent normal distribution approximation for each parameter
* **Assumption**: parameters are **independent**
* **Reality**: even though parameters are **not** independent, still works well

## Evaluation

* **Accuracy** is **not** a good metric, since the dataset is extremely skews \(much more normal cases than anomaly\)
* Possible evaluation metrics
  * True positive, false positive ...
  * Precision / Recall
  * $$F_1$$-score
* **Anomaly detection** vs **Supervised learning**
  * Anomaly detection
    1. **Very small number of positive** examples and **large number of negative** examples
    2. **Many** different possible "**types**" of anomalies. Future anomalies may look nothing like any of the anomalous examples we have seen in the training set \(an aircraft has so many parts that could go wrong\)
  * Supervised learning
    1. **Large number of both positive and negative** examples
    2. Future positive examples likely to be similar to the positives in the training set
