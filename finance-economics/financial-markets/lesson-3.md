# Lesson 3

## Insurance

* **Risk Pooling** is the source of insurance
* **Moral Hazard** dealt with partially by deductions and co-insurance
  * Risk goes higher due to the object's moral issue \(intentional accident\)
* **Selection Bias** dealt with by group policies, by testing and referrals, and by mandatory government insurance
  * Example: only sick people sign up health insurance, while healthy people don't. Hence the risk goes higher.
* Government set up funds just in case insurance company goes bankrupt
* **The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945** delegated insurance regulation to the **states**, **not at federal** level

## Health Insurance

* Why: doctors make more money when people are sick, so they have no "monetary incentive" to keep people healthy
* Result: 
  1. **The Health Maintenance Act of 1973**
  2. **The U.S. Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act \(EMTALA\) of 1986**
     1. Requires hospitals and ambulance services to provide care to anyone needing emergency treatment
     2. An "unfunded mandate"
     3. Not a great system
  3. **The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 \(Obama-care\)**
     1. **Mandatory** \(penalty for individuals not buying insurance and companies not buying insurance for its employees\)
     2. Insurance companies may not disallow for preexisting conditions, or drop people who get sick

## Disasters

* Most people do not have insurance against natural disasters \(e.g. earthquake\)
* **Earthquake in Haiti vs. Hurricane in U.S.**  
* **Terrorism**
  * Before 9/11. insurers generally did not exclude terrorism risk, which they then saw as inconsequential.

## Quiz

1. Risk pooling is most effective when the individual events are **independent**.
2. **Insurance salesman** \(explaining the benefits of life insurance to people who didn't know\), **new sales pitch** \(explaining to housewives without probability theory, which was formerly used\) and **XXX** are main factors that led to the proliferation of life insurance.
3. In U.S., when an insurance company goes bankrupt, the customers are insured from company failure at the **state** level
4. The Obamacare attempted to address the **selection bias** by **forcing everyone to buy health insurance, or else receive penalty**.
5. One main reason why house-owners in Louisiana did not have flood insurance before the advent of Katarina Hurricane was because many insurance companies in Louisiana **raised the insurance premium due to fear of hurricanes**.
