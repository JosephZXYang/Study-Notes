# 8. Unsupervised Learning

## Clustering

* Group data points to different segments
* Data points do not have labels
* Unsupervised learning algorithm

## K-means Clustering

* Most widely used clustering algorithm
* **Steps**
  1. Randomize $$k$$ cluster centroids
  2. Go through all data points. Assign each point to its closest centroid. 
  3. Compute mean for each cluster. Move cluster centroids to their mean.
  4. Repeat step 2, 3 until convergence
