# 4. Nonlinear Hypotheses

## Non-linear Classification

* Possible solutions
  * Include **all quadratic terms**
    * Could **overfit**
    * Computationally expensive
  * Include **a subset of quadratic terms**
    * **Data not enough**
  * Or even higher orders
    * Same problems could occur
* Simple logistic regression is not effective in computer vision problems
  * **TOO MANY** features

## Neurons and Brains

* Goal: machine mimicking human brains
*
