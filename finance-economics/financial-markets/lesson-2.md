# Lesson 2

## VaR

* **Variance**
* **Value at Risk**
* Term invented after stock market crash of 1987
* VaR is quoted in **units of $ for a given probability and time horizon**

## Stress Tests

* OFHEO started testing firms' ability to withstand economic crisis before the 2008 crisis, but failed
* A method of assessing risks of firms

* Measures stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges
* Market Risk: risk caused by aggregate market
* Idiosyncratic Risk: risk only due to the firm's operations

## Distributions and Outliers

* **CLT \(Central Limit Theorem\)** tells that averages of a large number of independent identically distributed random variables \(whose variance is finite\) are **approximately normally distributed**, **unless** the random variables are **fat tailed** or **lose their independence**.
* Cauchy distribution is a fat-tailed distribution
