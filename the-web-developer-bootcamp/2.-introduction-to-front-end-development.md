# 2. Introduction to Front-End Development

## Internet Basics

1. **Finding the right address of the request page**
   * The query is submitted to ISP.
   * Within the ISP, the DNS takes the domain name and turns it into an IP address.
2. **Going to that address**
   * The request is sent to the desired IP via HTTP.
   * The request finds the fastest way to reach the desired IP.
3.  **Server response** 
   * The requested server figures out what the request actually asks for.
   * The server builds the right content and responds with combination of HTML, css, javascript.
