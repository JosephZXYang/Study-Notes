# 25. Server Side Frameworks

## Framework

* Framework vs. Library
  * We call functions pre-written in library
  * Functions in framework call our code
* Workflow already built in a framework, with white spaces that our code to fill in to fit our need
* This course uses _**Express**_
* Heavy weight vs. Light weight
  * Heavy weight frameworks do more for programmers
  * Light weight frameworks offer more freedom for programmers
* **Routes**
  * **Listeners for different requests**
    * Get
    * Post

## What is "package.json"?

* Important metadata of the package
* Since a large project may have a ton of dependencies, instead of upload all dependency packages the project used, just include dependencies in `package.json`
* npm `--save` flag
  * Takes the package info and save it to the dependency section of `package.json` file.
* npm `init` command
  * Initializes a command procedure to help create a `package.json` file
