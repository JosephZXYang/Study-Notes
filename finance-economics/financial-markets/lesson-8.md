# Lesson 8

## 1982 Savings Account

* Need a passbook
* "**Term**" is the **minimum** **amount** of time that must pass before you can withdraw your money without penalty

## Federal Funds and Interest Rates

* Federal Funds Rate: shortest-term interest rate in U.S.
* EONIA \(the European federal funds rate\) was allowed to go negative because the cost of storing money is expensive: transportation, insurance and other expenses
* Causes of interest rates: \(Bawerk 1884\) "the rate of progression is roughly the same as the interest rate"
* Roundabout production process: make promise about production of next year, make investment using current capital

## Compound Interest

* If annual rate is $$r$$, balance will be $$(1+r)^t$$after $$t$$years
* If compounded $$k$$times a year, balance will be $$(1+r/k)^{tk}$$after $$t$$years
* If continuous compounding, balance is $$e^{rt}$$\(taking limit of the value above as $$k\rightarrow \infty$$

## Discount Bonds

* Initially sold at a discount and price rises through time, creating income
* Coupon bonds - anonymous bond with no name on record

## Consol and Annuity

* Even though the British government pays constant amount annually, the present-day value of the consol varies due to market risk.

## Forward Rates and Expectation Theory

* Problem: in **1925** **expect** to have $100 to invest in **1926**, but want the money back in **1927. How to guarantee the interest rate on the $100 investment today in 1925?**
* **Solution given by Sir John Hicks**
  1. **Buy in 2-period discount bonds maturing at $100 in 1927**
  2. **Short in 1925 one 1-period discount bond maturing at $100 in 1926**

## Inflation

* **Real interest rates \(John Bates Clark 1895\)**
  * Take inflation into account
  * $$(1+r_{money}) = (1+r_{real})(1+i_{inflation})$$
  * Approximately: $$r_{money} \approx r_{real}+i$$
* Index bonds
  * Bonds that pay coupons defined in **real** terms

## Leverage

* Leverage
  * **Put more money** into the asset than you have \(borrow money to buy assets\)
  * Leveraging increases risk
  * Examples
    * **Profit**: have $100, borrow $100, asset value doubles up, now you have $\(100+100\)\*2-$100=$300, rather than $200 before leveraging
    * **Loss**: have $100, borrow $100, asset value halves, now you have $\(100+100\)/2-$100=$0, rather than $50 before leveraging
  * China today is highly leveraged
