# 32. Data Association

## Data Association

* Connect data \(relations\)
* Types
  * one:one
    * one book has one publisher
  * one:many
    * one user have many posts
  * many:many
    * many students enrolled in many courses

## Embed data

* Manually embed complete data object of some schema into data of some other schema

## Refer data

* Similar to embedding, but rather than complete data object, the embedded data object just has two properties
  * type: `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`
  * ref: `"Post"` \(the type of the data object\)
