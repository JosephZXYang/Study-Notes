# 12. JavaScript Functions

## JavaScript Scope

* Without the variable declaration tag `var` , we would use the value of the variable declared in broader scope. An example is as follows:
  * `var y = 99`  \(declare in **global scope**\)
  * `function doSomething() { y = 100; console.log(y); }` \(declare a function in **global scope**\)
  * `doSomething()`  \(we call the function in **global scope**\)
  * and `100`  will be printed in console, instead of 99!
