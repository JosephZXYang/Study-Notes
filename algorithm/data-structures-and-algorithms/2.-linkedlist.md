# 2. LinkedList

## What is Linked List

* A linear structure
  * **Linear**: only one element can be reached each time
  * **Linear**: elements have to be reached sequentially
* Each element is a separate object
  * **Separate**: the existence of one specific element does not affect the correctness of the linked list
* Each element comprises **two** items
  * **Data**
  * **Reference** to the next node
* **Variable size**
* Analogy
  * A train with multiple compartments
  * New compartment can be added anywhere \(between any two old compartments\)
  * Old compartment can be removed anytime
* **Components**
  * **Head**: reference to the head node
  * **Nodes**: data nodes
  * **Tail**: reference to the tail node
* **Types**
  * **Single linked list**: each node **only** stores reference to the **next** node
  * **Circular single linked list**: the **last** node stores reference to the **head** node
  * **Double linked list**: each node stores reference to the **next** and **previous** node

## Linked List vs. Array

* **Separate object** vs. **Unremovable cell**
* **Variable** size vs. **Fixed** size
* **Sequential** access vs. **Random** Access

## Memory Storage

* **Array**
  * **Sequential** area of memory allocated
  * Pointer points to the **start** of the area allocated
  * Hence **constant time access**
* **Linked List**
  * **Random** memory allocated for **each** **element**
  * No need to know how much memory need to be allocated when declaring the list
  * Hence **linear time access**

## Time Complexity

* Single linked list

* Circular single linked list
  * For deleting the entire list, **break the loop first** \(set `tail.next=null` \) to enable garbage collection \(break the circular reference\), and then set head and tail to `null` .

* Double linked list
  * For deleting the entire list, just like CSLL, either remove all `next` or all `prev` references so that garbage collection could be enabled.
  * Time complexity same as CSLL, except that deletion of list is $$O(n)$$
