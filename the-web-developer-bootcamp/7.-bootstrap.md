# 7. Bootstrap

## Bootstrap Intro

* Single CSS file and JavaScript file with many other CSS/JavaScript files included
* Many built-in useful components
  * Glyph-icon
  * Buttons
  * Navbar
  * Jumbotron
  * Etc

## Adding Bootstrap to Your Application

* Two ways of "installation"
  * Download the Bootstrap files locally and link to the files
  * Link to external Bootstrap files hosted online
* Bootstrap just provides many classes. So we can easily overwrite the attributes with our own CSS file.
* Buttons
  * Classes
    * `btn`
    * `btn-lg` `btn-xs`
    * `btn-success`
  * Attributes
    * `disabled="disabled"`
    * `active`

## Forms and Inputs

* Jumbotron
  * How to use: `<div class="jumbotron">`
* Container
  * A `div` element with automatic center margin/padding/etc.
* Form
  * `form-group` combines elements closer and split different groups
  * `form-control`

## Navbar

* `<nav class="navbar navbar-default"`
  * A default navbar
* `<div class="navbar-header">`
  * A navbar header
* `<a href="#" class="navbar-brand">SomeBrand</a>`
  * A navbar brand that links to the same page
* `<ul class="nav navbar-nav">`
  * A navbar unordered list with items starting from the left
* `<ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">`
  * A navbar unordered list with items starting from the right
* To make drop-down menus work, import the Bootstrap JavaScript file.
* `div class="collapse navbar-collapse"`
  * A div inside navbar that will be collapsed when the size reaches mobile size
  * Create a collapse button with `data-target` linked to the div that we want to collapse

## Grid System

* Idea: Adapt to different sizes
* Every element can be divided to 12 columns with same width
* To use the grid system, we have to start with `<div class="container">`
* Four different classes that adapt to different devices with different width
  * `column-lg-*`
  * `column-md-*`
  * `column-sm-*`
  * `column-xs-*`
* With extra small \(tablet sizes\), the nested rows would just stack on top of each other.
