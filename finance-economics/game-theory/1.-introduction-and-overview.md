# 1. Introduction and Overview

## Self-Interested Agents

* Each agent has its own description of states of the world that it likes, and acts based on this description
* Each agent has a **utility function**
  * Act to maximize **expected utility**
  * **Quantifies the description of preferences**

## Define a Game

* **Key Components**
  * **Players**: who are the decision makers?
  * **Actions**: what can the players do?
  * **Payoffs**: what motivates the players?
* **Two Standard Representations**
  * **Normal Form \(a.k.a. Matrix Form\)**: List payoffs as a function of possible actions
  * **Extensive Form**: Includes timing of moves
    * Better represented as a decision tree

## Strategic Reasoning

* Each player _**best responds**_ to others: **Nash Equilibrium**
* **Nash Equilibrium**
  * A consistent list of actions
  * Each player's action maximizes his or her payoff given the action of the others
  * Nobody has an incentive to deviate from their action if an equilibrium profile is played
  * If there is someone has an incentive to deviate, then it's not an equilibria
  * A self-consistent or stable profile

## Dominant Strategies

* **Strictly dominates**: one strategy has payoff **always greater than** the payoff of another
* **Very weakly dominates**: one strategy has payoff **greater or equal to** the payoff of another
* If one strategy **dominates all others**, we say it's _**dominant**_
* **A strategy profile consisting of dominant strategies for every player must be a Nash equilibrium**
  * An equilibrium in strictly dominant strategies must be unique

## Pareto Optimality

* Consider outcome from the view of an **third-party observer**
* **Idea**: one outcome $$o$$ is **at least as good** for every agent as another outcome $$o'$$, and there is some agent who strictly prefers $$o$$ to $$o'$$
  * E.g. $$o=(7,8), o'=(7,2)$$, as good for player 1, but player 2 strictly prefers $$o$$
  * We say that $$o$$ **Pareto-dominates** $$o'$$
* **Pareto Optimality**: An outcome where there is **no** other outcome that Pareto-dominates it.
  * A game can have multiple Pareto-optimal outcomes \(several outcomes that are the same\)
  * Everyone has to have at least one Pareto-optimal outcome.
* The _**paradox**_ of Prisoner's dilemma:
  * The Nash equilibrium is the only **non**-Pareto-optimal outcome.
  * In other words, from the view of an **observer**, **any other choice should be Pareto-optimal**
