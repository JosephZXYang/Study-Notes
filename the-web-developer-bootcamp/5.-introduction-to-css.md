# 5. Introduction to CSS

## CSS Basics

* Stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**
* The General Rule for CSS
  * `selector {property: value; anotherProperty: anotherValue}`
* Where can we place the styles?
  * Inline: a bad choice, because we need to duplicate the change so many times if we have many elements with the same styles on a page
  * Style tag \(put a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` element\): works much better, but still violates our idea to separate the structure \(HTML\) and style \(CSS\).
  * Write CSS in a separate file and link the HTML to the CSS.

## CSS Colors

* Color name notation
  * Just English words that represent common colors
  * Built-in, but normally don't use this notation
* Hexadecimal notation
  * `#??????` where `??????` is a string of 6 hexadecimal numbers ranging from 0 to F
  * First 2 digits stand for red channel \(00 - FF\)
  * Middle 2 digits stand for green channel \(00 - FF\)
  * Last 2 digits stand for blue channel \(00 - FF\)
  * Refer to online color picker
* RGB notation
  * `rgb(?, ?, ?)` where each `?` is a number ranging from 0 to 255
  * First argument stands for red channel \(0 - 255\)
  * Second argument stands for green channel \(0 - 255\)
  * Third argument stands for blue channel \(0 - 255\)
* RGBA notation
  * `rgba(?, ?, ?, ?)` with first three arguments exactly the same as in RGB and the last channel represents the alpha \(transparency\) ranging from 0.0 - 1.0.

## Background and Borders

* Background
  * Background with color: `background: rgb(255, 0, 0)` 
  * Background with image: `background: url(someValidUrl)` 
    * Without repetition: `background-repeat: no-repeat`
    * With stretching: `background-size: cover`
* Border
  * Border with color: `border-color: rgb(1, 1, 1)`
  * Border width: `border-width: 1px`
  * Border style: `border-style: solid`
  * Border: `border: 1px solid pink`

## Basic Selectors

* ID selector
  * Selects the single element with specific id that we are looking for
  * Each id can only be used once on a page
  * `#theID {}` selects the element with id `theID`
* Class Selector
  * Selects all elements within the class we are looking for
  * All elements with the same class name belongs to the same class and will be selected
  * `.className {}` selects all elements within the class `className`
* Element selector
  * Selects all elements with the matching tag
  * `div {}` for example
  * Or `h1 {}` for another example

## More Selectors

* Star selector
  * Selects **every element** on the page
  * `* {}`
* Descendant selector
  * Selects all elements with the matching tag and element hierarchy
  * `tagGrandParent tagParent tag {}` selects all elements with tag `tag` that are inside an element with tag `tagParent` that is inside an element with tag `tagGrandParent`
  * This hierarchy can repeat any number of times
  * `tag` can be changed to a class `.class`
* Adjacent selector
  * Select adjacent element after an element on the **same** level
  * `h4 + ul` select un-ordered lists after heading 4. Notice that without the `+` we would select `ul` inside `h4`
* Attribute selector
  * Select all elements with the matching tag and attribute
  * `tag[someAttribute="someValue"]` selects all elements with tag `tag` and `someAttribute="someValue"`
* Nth of type
  * Select the nth element with the matching tag
  * `li:nth-of-type(3)` selects the third list elements of **all lists**

## Inherits and Specificity

* CSS automatically calculates a numeric value for each selector to decide which selector is the correct one \(most specific one\) for an element if that element matches several selector.
