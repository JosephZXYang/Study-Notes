# 11. JavaScript Basics

## Boolean Logic

* **True / False**
* Comparison operators
  * `==`  `!=`  only compares value
    * `5 == "5"`  is **true**
    * `undefined == null`  is **true**
  * `===`  `!==`  checks value and type
    * `5 === "5"`  is **false**
    * `undefined === null`  is **false**
  * Interesting cases
    * `true == "1"`  is **true**
    * `0 == false`  is **true**
    * `NaN == NaN` **** is **false**
* Logical Operators
  * AND `&&` , OR `||` , NOT `!`
  * `0 "" undefined null false NaN`  are **false** values.
  * Everything else are **true** values.
* Conditionals
* `prompt`  asks for an input from the user and **always** take the input as a **string.**
* `typeof`  checks the type of a value.
