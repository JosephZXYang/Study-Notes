# Lesson 7

## Introduction to Behavioral Finance

* The term, "_**Behavioral Finance**_", came around **1990**, a revolution
* The idea first appeared in **Adam Smith**'s book, _**Theory of Moral Sentiments**_, **1759**
  * **Throughout life, people like to be praised.**
  * As people mature, the desire for praise morphs into a desire for **praiseworthiness** \(get praised for what he or she **actually** **did**\).
* Mathematicians
  * It seems that mathematicians don't enjoy much fame as singers do.
  * The reason is, their academic circle is small. They receive respect from people in the academia, and they get pleasure from receiving such respect.

## Prospect Theory

* **Kahneman** and **Tversky**, _**Econometrica**_, **1979**
  * Great paper, the mostly quoted paper in econometric at that time
  * Criticizes the expected utility theory, the core theory of economics, and replaces it with a constructive alternative
* Two proposed changes
  1. Replaced the **utility function** with **value function**
  2. Replaced **probabilities** with **subjective probabilities** determined by a weighting function in terms of the actual probabilities
     * Gain: concave downward and growing \(like utility function\)
     * Loss: concave upward
* Value function
  * The origin moves with the person \(different day, different starting point\)
  * Implications
    * People don't tend to take small bets \(small loss = relatively much larger value decreased\)
    * People are NOT absolutely rational
* Weighing function
  * Lower than 45 degree straight line
  * Starts at a point with $$p>0.0$$and ends at a point with $$p<1.0$$
  * At the starting point, decision weight is relatively much greater than stated probability.
  * At the ending point, decision weight is relatively much smaller than stated probability.
* Key motivation of prospect theory
  * **The psychological experiments do not align with traditional economics assumptions**
  * People have biased interpretations of actual probabilities
* Two revolutions in the past 50 years in Finance
  * Efficient market 
  * Behavioral finance
* Interpretation: **people care too much about losing money, even though the expectation is positive according to stated probabilities.**

## Logical Fallacies

* **Overconfidence**
  * **Wishful thinking**
  * People tend to exaggerate the probability that their team will win
* **Cognitive dissonance**
  * The **mental conflict** that occurs when **one's beliefs are discovered to be wrong**

## The Brain

* **Mental Compartments**
  * People have two "portfolios" - "safe" portion vs. "risk" portion
* **Attention Anomalies**
  * People can't pay attention to everything
  * "Do we watch the stock market all the time?"
  * **Social basis: people tend to look at what others look at**
  * Everyone looking at the same stock causes overpricing
* **Anchoring**
  * Decisions affected by some anchors \(formal information, surrounding information\)
    * Example: 10-dollar biscuit looks expensive in a shop filled with 3-dollar biscuits, but cheap in a shop filled with 100-dollar biscuits.

## Magical Thinking

* **Magical thinking**
  * People make reasoning/assumptions that they think are right but not necessarily logical/relevant
  * Pigeon Experiment
    * Hungry pigeons are automatically fed by a machine at a slow pace.
    * They started to dance weirdly
    * Reason: they accidentally danced at some time, then the machine fed food. They believed that the dance is connected to food being provided.
* **Quasi-magical thinking**
