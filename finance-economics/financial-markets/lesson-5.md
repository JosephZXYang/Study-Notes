# Lesson 5

## Invention Takes Time

* Ideas that seem simple and natural somehow don't get established at the time they were created.
* Financial theory and practice are good areas for young people to go into because they have been transforming and will continue to transform in at least 50 years.
* New opportunities \(mental quirks of human species\) occur from time to time to make the human species evolute, but they do not fit in the modern world when they take place. We are excessively fearful or unwilling to change.

## Innovation

* Financial innovation is a pillar of our civilization.
* Financial innovation is a sequence of inventions that 
  * incentivize people
  * provide capital for enterprises.
* Reframe risk so that they are appealing to investors.

## Limited Liabilities

* **New York State, 1811**
  * Investors are **only** responsible for the money they put in to the company/stock.
  * Investors **should not** be responsible for the failure/mistake of the company.
    * While they **do** **go** **to** **jail** **due to** **crimes of the company**, e.g. fraud.
* Other states rejects the act.
  * Massachusetts even passed a law at the same time, reaffirming that investors **should** be responsible.
* As a result, all investors went to New York and NY became a mecca for business.
* Eventually, all states passed the same law.
* Note: limited liabilities is the precondition of diversified portfolio.

## Inflation Indexed Dept

* Real value of currency is unstable \(especially when the government prints a lot\)
* Approach 1: bond related to one commodity \(rice, a very common one\)
  * Problem: value of rice is also unstable
* Approach 2: indexed debt
  * **First -** **United States, 1780**
  * **Due to high inflation after the revolutionary war**
* The indexed bonds in **1780** were issued by **Massachusetts**, but **no state** issued indexed bonds **again** until **1997**

## Unidad de Fomento

* **"Unit of Development"**
* In economics, money is defined in terms of the three functions it provides:
  1. **a store of value**
  2. **a unit of account**
  3. **a medium of transaction**
* **Chile, 1967**
  * **Hyperinflation**
